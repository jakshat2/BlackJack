      <ul>
        <p>Rule</p>
        <li>Beat the dealer’s hand to get 21 or as close to as possible</li>
        <li>If you get 21 points exactly on the deal, that is called a “<strong>blackjack</strong>.” (Ace and a ten
          value
          card)</li>
        <li>The dealer and you have two cards. You have all cards face up and the dealer has one card up and one card
          face down</li>
        <p>Card Values</p>
        <li>Cards 2-10 are worth the value of the number on the face of the card</li>
        <li>Face cards (Jacks, Queens and Kings) are worth 10. Ace can be either 1 or 11</li>
        <p>The Player's choice</p>
        <li><strong>HIT</strong> - you can get one more card</li>
        <li><strong>STAND</strong> - you don’t want any more cards</li>
        <p>Who is winner?</p>
        <li>After you called "Stand," the dealer turns their card. If dealer has 16 or under then they must take another
          card</li>
        <li><strong>Win</strong>: If you have a blackjack, or you get higher points than the dealer</li>
        <li><strong>Lose</strong>: If you have gone over 21, or the dealer has same or over points than you</li>
        <li>Blackjack can only beats blackjack. So if the dealer and you both have blackjack, game is
          <strong>Draw</strong>. Otherwise
          the person who has blackjack win</li>
      </ul>
